# RC6Ch_Arduino_Car
Can be used with any motor driver(with PWM in), and any RC reciver with minimum 4 channels

For my project I have used a 20Amp Motor Driver which I bought from Robokits.co.in

Yeah, So Its been an year or 2 since I have done this project but I think the code for this which I wrote is super useful

What I liked most about this particular motor driver is that it has a breaking feature.That is if I pull the brk Pin high I can hault the motors

This feature can used to make the robot car drift !


Note: This code was written with the FLYSKY FSi6 RC reciver , Therefore if using any other RC Reciever you may need to change the PWM values 

Feel free to edit the code and put in appropriate values for best performance...

ENJOY!
